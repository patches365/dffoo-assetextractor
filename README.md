Script that extracts embedded G1M, G1T, and G2A assets from .bin objects.

Only tested with Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia files.

Usage:
Run the .exe file and select one or multiple files for the script to examine.  The script will search the file for G1M model files, G1T texture files, and G2A animation files, then export them to their own individual files.  Exported files will be saved to the same folder as the base file with an additional _XXX index number applied.
